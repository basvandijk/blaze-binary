  binary: efficient, pure binary serialisation using lazy ByteStrings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'binary' package provides Data.Binary, containing the Binary class,
and associated methods, for serialising values to and from lazy
ByteStrings. 

A key feature of 'binary' is that the interface is both pure, and efficient.

Building:

    runhaskell Setup.hs configure
    runhaskell Setup.hs build
    runhaskell Setup.hs install

Use:
    import Data.Binary

and then write an instance of Binary for the type you wish to serialise.
More information in the haddock documentation.
